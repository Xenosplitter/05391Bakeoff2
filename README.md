Carnegie Mellon University's Designing Human Centered Software's S1 Bakeoff Two is an open-ended design challenge to develop rapid prototyping skills.

The project consists of a Processing pde file that has the user reposition a blue box to overlap a randomly placed red outlined box somewhere on the canvas. This destination can be in any X or Y position, at any rotation R, and at some size Z. The user must then use a set of controls to move, rotate, and resize the blue box to match the destination box to 0.05 inches. The only input allowed is with the left mouse button.

Any modifications made cannot violate the following rule: No set of XYRZ coordinates can be preffered over another set
